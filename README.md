# PublicLaTeXCV
My new public CV for new job roles. Made proudly with LaTeX and TeXStudio! 

I usually build it with TexStudio and not the command line. If you don't have TeXStudio (but you _do_ have TeXLive and pdflatex installed), it uses the command
```bash
pdflatex -synctex=1 -interaction=nonstopmode "CV".tex
```
to build the CV as a PDF.
